# Build the nitro-node and nitro-node-dev images on ARM64 and AMD64 hosts.
#
# The reason for building the ARM image natively instead of with QEMU is that
# the QEMU build always failed after around 40 minutes. I'm currently not sure
# why it failed. I did also run into insufficient space issuse on public runners
# so it's possible this was always the culprit.
#
# After building, the images are merged together to make a multiplatform image.
#
# The latest wavm machine is also copied and exported as an artifact. In nitro
# this seems to be later used as machine for the non-dev nitro-node build.
# For more details on that see the Dockerfile and ./scripts/download.sh
