# Q: Is Arbitrum One a trustless, permissionless, decentralized chain?

Arbitrum One runs on a [full, feature complete implementation]((https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)) of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol; given that this is still fairly new technology, however, we currently maintain administrative "training wheels." The centralized components of the system will be progressively phased out over time.
