To interact with Arbitrum One (mainet) and the Goerli testnet, you can rely on the same popular node providers that you are already using on Ethereum. There are multiple providers that may help you build on Arbitrum, here is a list of a couple of them.

## [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=arbitrum-docs)

Alchemy provides endpoints for both Arbitrum One (mainnet) and Arbitrum's Goerli testnet. To use these RPC endpoints, you just create a free account [here](https://alchemy.com/arbitrum/?a=arbitrum-docs) and set up an **_Alchemy API key_** to authenticate your requests. For detailed steps of how to get started, see [Alchemy's API key documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/introduction/getting-started#1.create-an-alchemy-key).

After you've set up your API key, you choose between the two RPC endpoints (Arbitrum One mainnet or Goerli testnet) offered by Alchemy. These endpoints allow for users to read and write to the Arbitrum blockchain faster and more reliably. You can interact with the endpoints directly in the command line or point your wallet's RPC endpoints to them. 

Beyond providing RPC endpoints, Alchemy is the popular choice amongst developers for its full suite of web3 developer tools - it has created many [enhanced APIs](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/enhanced-apis-overview) (e.g., NFT APIs, Notify APIs, transaction receipt APIs,etc) that simplify builds and has the most comprehensive javascript [SDK](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart) (a superset of several ethers.js libraries). Additionally, Alchemy has created a hub of developer tutorials and resources including [Road to Web3](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3) and [Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com/).

Alchemy's robust free tier gives users 300M compute units ("CUs") per month for free, or the equivalent of 30M getLatestBlock requests. Sign up [here](https://alchemy.com/arbitrum). 

## [Infura](https://infura.io/)

Infura is a node service provider that provides access to Arbitrum One (Mainnet) and Goerli testnet. To start interacting with either of these networks, you need to [set up an Infura account](https://infura.io/register) and create a new key. For detailed steps, check out Infura's [documentation](https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/arbitrum).

Infura provides access to Arbitrum across all their subscription plans (Core Free, Developer, Team & Growth). See [pricing & daily request rate limits](https://infura.io/pricing).

## [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)

QuickNode supports Arbitrum One Mainnet and Goerli testnet, as well as Arbitrum Nova Mainnet, and allows users to interact with these chains.

For a full guide of how to use an Arbitrum node on QuickNode, see the [QuickNode's Arbitrum](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum) and [Quicknode's Arbitrum Nova documentation](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum-nova).

[Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/accounts/new-signup) provides 10 million API credits per month for Arbitrum for free.

## [Moralis](https://moralis.io/)

Moralis allows Arbitrum users and developers to connect to both Arbitrum One (Mainnet). To do so, you need to create an account and choose the node you wish to connect to. You will then be presented with a pair of URLs (Arbitrum Mainnet and Testnet) with which you can interact with directly in the command line or point your [wallet's](https://portal.arbitrum.one/#wallets) RPC endpoints to them. For full guide and more explanation, see the [Moralis's documentation](https://moralis.io/full-guide-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum-nodes/).

## [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)

Ankr provides access to both Arbitrum One (Mainnet). After creating an Ankr account, you will be presented with a pair of URLs which you can use to connect to any of our networks. For more details, see the [Ankr's documentation](https://docs.ankr.com/blockchains/arbitrum/develop-on-arbitrum).

## [BlockVision](https://blockvision.org/)

BlockVision provides Arbitrum One mainnet node services. See [BlockVision Dashboard](https://dashboard.blockvision.org/connect).

## [GetBlock](https://getblock.io/)

GetBlock is a service that provides instant API connection to full nodes of many leading blockchain networks, including Arbitrum One (Mainnet) available for shared and dedicated nodes.

For detailed steps on how to set up an Arbitrum node, check [GetBlock’s documentation](https://getblock.io/docs/)

GetBlock’s pricing for Arbitrum starts from \$6 for 500K requests. Also, GetBlock offers a free plan for testing.

## [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)

Chainstack currently supports the Arbitrum Goerli testnet and Arbitrum One Mainnet (including Archive node support).

See [documentation](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-arbitrum/) for more info.

## [NOWNodes](https://nownodes.io/?utm_source=arbitrum&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=arbitrum)

[NOWNodes](https://nownodes.io/?utm_source=arbitrum&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=arbitrum) is a blockchain-as-a-service that provides access to almost 60 full nodes and explorers via API. Through the usage of NOWNodes you can easily connect to [full Arbitrum nodes](https://nownodes.io/nodes/arbitrum?utm_source=arbitrum&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=arbitrum) and block explorer.

In order to establish a connection, you just need to utilize specific codes and commands that can be found in [the official documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13630829/TVmFkLwy?utm_source=arbitrum&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=arbitrum).
