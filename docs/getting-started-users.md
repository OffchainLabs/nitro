# Getting Started

_**Note: before interacting with a mainnet chain, users should familiarize themselves with the risks; see [Mainnet Beta](mainnet-beta)**_.

Welcome to Arbitrum! Dapp developers can build on Arbitrum seamlessly using popular Ethereum tools like [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/), a preferred developer platform for web3 apps. 

If you're a developer, check out [our developer-focused "getting started" page](https://developer.arbitrum.io/getting-started-devs).  


# Becoming an Arbitrum user

#### Connect to a RPC endpoint

An RPC endpoint is necessary to read and write to the blockchain. A full list is [here](https://developer.arbitrum.io/getting-started-devs). 

#### Acquire Some Native Currency 

For both testnet and mainnet, you'll need a chain's native currency to transact. You can either acquire funds directly on an Arbitrum chain, or get funds on a chain's underlying L1 and bridge it across. 

- **Testnet**

  Goerli is the only supported testnet after the Ethereum merge. You can get Goerli test Ether ("testETH") from Alchemy's free faucet below:

  [**Goerli faucet**](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

- **Mainnet**
 
  Once you're ready to deploy into mainnet, [supported centralized exchanges](https://portal.arbitrum.one/#centralizedexchanges) allow you to purchase (mainnet) Ether and withdraw it directly onto Arbitrum one.

#### Deposit & Withdraw

To move your Ether and Tokens between Arbitrum and Ethereum chains, visit [bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

#### Use L2 Dapps

Interacting with Arbitrum chains will feel very similar to using Ethereum, just cheaper and faster! To get a sense of what's out there, you can check out our [portal page](https://portal.arbitrum.one/), where we showcase some of the dApps, wallets, and infrastructure currently live on Arbitrum One.

#### Connect your Wallet

Connect [your wallet](https://portal.arbitrum.one/#wallets) to an Arbitrum chain, adding the chain's RPC endpoint if required.
