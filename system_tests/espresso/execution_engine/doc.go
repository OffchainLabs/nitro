// Package execution_engine provides utility mock implementations of the
// execution engine specifically for testing purposes.
//
// Currently this package contains a mock for use with the TransactionStreamer,
// as it provides implementation details against the interaction discovered
// within the TransactionStreamer.
//
// Additionally, it provides a blank UnimplementedExecutionEngine implementation
// that allows other Mocks to be created more easily.
