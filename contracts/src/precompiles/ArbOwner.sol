/// @notice Calls by non-owners will always revert.
/// Most of Arbitrum Classic's owner methods have been removed since they no longer make sense in Nitro:
/// - What were once chain parameters are now parts of ArbOS's state, and those that remain are set at genesis.
/// - ArbOS upgrades happen with the rest of the system rather than being independent
/// - Exemptions to address aliasing are no longer offered. Exemptions were intended to support backward compatibility for contracts deployed before aliasing was introduced, but no exemptions were ever requested.
