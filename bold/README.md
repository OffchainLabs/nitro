# BOLD

This repository implements Offchain Labs' BOLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay) Protocol: a dispute system to enable permissionless validation of Arbitrum chains. It is an efficient, all-vs-all challenge protocol that enables anyone on Ethereum to challenge invalid rollup state transitions. 

BOLD provides a fixed, upper-bound on challenge confirmations for Arbitrum chains.

Given state transitions are deterministic, this guarantees only one correct result for any given assertion. An **honest participant** will always win against malicious entities when challenging assertions posted to the settlement chain.

## Research Specification

BOLD has an accompanying research specification that outlines the foundations of the protocol in more detail, found under [docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf](./docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf).


## Security Audit

BOLD has been audited by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) as of commit [60f97068c12cca73c45117a05ba1922f949fd6ae](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/commit/60f97068c12cca73c45117a05ba1922f949fd6ae), and a more updated audit is being completed, to be finalized in the coming few weeks.

The audit report can be found under [docs/audits/TrailOfBitsAudit](./docs/audits/TrailOfBitsAudit.pdf).
