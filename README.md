# Arbitrum Nitro

Nitro is currently available as a public devnet.  This code is under
development and has not yet been released for production use.

During the devnet period, we have licensed the Nitro stack under a 
Business Source License, similar to our friends at Uniswap and Aave. 
Before mainnet launch, we will be re-licensing the code under an 
additional community license to ensure that everyone can have full comfort 
using and running nodes on Arbitrum One.
